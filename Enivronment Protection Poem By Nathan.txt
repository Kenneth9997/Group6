Hear me out and never doubt
Give a smile and never pout
God's creation on the scene
Captivating evergreen
Existing domain magnificient
Gazing upon the artistic firmament

Love for Mother Nature , you shall bring
Protect and preserve everything
Discipline is the key
To unlock the mystery
For what we see are untainted
Uphold it to be enlightened

We are born to alleviate 
And not to abominate
For the world is our home to carry
It's not a burden but a sanctuary

Composed by: Nathaniel John A. Calimlim (Own Compostion)
